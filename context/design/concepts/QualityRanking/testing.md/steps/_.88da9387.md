# QualityRanking Concept

concept  QualityRanking \[Place]
purpose surface lesser-known places that have high engagement but low mainstream visibility
principle compute a score that promotes well-loved places regardless of popularity,
helping users discover authentic local favorites

state
a set of RankingMetrics with
a placeId Id
a engagementRatio Number
a visitorVolume Number
a qualityScore Number
a lastUpdated Date

a set of RankingPreferences with
a userId Id
a prefersEmergent Flag
a radius Number

actions

updateMetrics (placeId: Id, visits: Number, engagement: Number)
requires place exists and visits >= 0 and engagement >= 0
effect updates metrics for place

calculateQualityScore (placeId: Id) : (score: Number)
requires place exists and has engagement metrics
effect computes engagement-to-visit ratio

setPreferences (userId: Id, prefersEmergent: Boolean, radius: Number)
requires user is authenticated and radius > 0
effect stores ranking preferences

getRecommendedPlaces (userId: Id, centerLat: Number, centerLng: Number) : (places: set Id)
requires user has ranking preferences and coordinates are valid
effect returns places within radius ranked by score

## Design Notes

* Quality score = engagement / max(visits, 1) to avoid division by zero
* prefersEmergent flag influences ranking: if true, prioritize lower visitor volume
* Places are filtered by radius before ranking
* Higher quality scores indicate "hidden gems" with good engagement but fewer visitors
* Metrics track both engagement ratio and visitor volume for flexible ranking
