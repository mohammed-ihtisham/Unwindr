[Original Spec](../../../context/design/concepts/PlaceCatalog/PlaceCatalog.md/steps/_.41cfdb5e.md)

[Enhancements to Spec](../../../context/design/brainstorming/questioning.md/steps/response.576021f1.md)

concept PlaceCatalog \[User]
purpose manage discoverable places and their basic data
principle users can add, verify, and update places; system can seed from provider

state
a set of Places with
an \_id Id
a name String
an address String
a category String
a verified Flag
an addedBy User
a location Location
a source String // "provider" or "user\_added"

a set of Locations with
a latitude Number
a longitude Number

actions
seedPlaces () : Empty | {error: string}
requires database is empty (0 places)
effect initial one-time seed of places for Cambridge, MA and Boston, MA from OpenStreetMap Overpass API

bulkImportOSMPlaces (osmDataPath: String) : Empty | {error: string}
requires osmDataPath points to valid GeoJSON file from OSM extract
effect performs one-time bulk import of places from OpenStreetMap data, checks for duplicates

addPlace (userId: Id, name: String, address: String, category: String, lat: Number, lng: Number) : (placeId: Id) | {error: string}
requires user is authenticated and name is not empty and coordinates are valid
effect creates user-added place, initially unverified

setPlaceVerificationStatus (placeId: Id, moderatorId: Id, isVerified: Boolean) : Empty | {error: string}
requires user has moderation privileges and place exists
effect sets the verification status of the place (true for verified, false for unverified/deactivated)

updatePlace (placeId: Id, name: String, address: String, userId: Id) : Empty | {error: string}
requires place exists and user is authenticated
effect updates place details

\_getPlacesInArea (centerLat: Number, centerLng: Number, radius: Number) : (places: \[Id]) | {error: string}
requires coordinates are valid and radius > 0
effect returns array of IDs of places found within specified circular area (radius in kilometers)

\_getPlaceDetails (placeId: Id) : (place: {name: String, address: String, ...}) | {error: string}
requires place exists
effect returns full details of specified place

checkAreaCoverage (centerLat: Number, centerLng: Number, radius: Number) : (placeCount: Number) | {error: string}
requires coordinates are valid and radius > 0
effect returns number of places already in database for this area, useful to check if seeding is needed
