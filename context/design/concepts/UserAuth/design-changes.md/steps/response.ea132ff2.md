# response:

The initial user authentication concept largely remains consistent with the original design, with no fundamental changes to its core functionality. The primary adjustments focus on technical alignment and clarity rather than shifts in the overall concept. Specifically, I've undertaken a renaming effort for several parameters within the various authentication actions to enhance readability and maintainability. A key structural change involves transitioning from using complex `User` types to simpler `Id` (or `UserId`) for identification purposes. This modification was implemented to better align the data model with MongoDB's document structure and to leverage primitive types, ensuring greater consistency and efficiency in database interactions.
