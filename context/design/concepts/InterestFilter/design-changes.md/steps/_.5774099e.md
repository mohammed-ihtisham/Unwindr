# Design Changes to InterestFilter

Prompt: Write at least 4-5 sentence explaining changes that I made to the concept and any other issues that came up: renaming some parameters in the actions and the use of Id instead of User types to align better with MongoDB and primitive types. redued minimum for tag validator as 3 because dont want to force user to limit option. added warnings to concept to better handle contradiction and updated contradction validator to better handle them later in the ui so users can choose which tags to choose when they oppsoe each other. set a threshold for confidence validator. initially llm had been using mock code cause it didnt properly take code from assignment 3 as context, and also didn't handle contradictions wholely (tried hardcoding a bunch of examples for a mock exercise)
