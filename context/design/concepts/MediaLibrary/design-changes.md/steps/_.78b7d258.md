# Design Changes to MediaLibrary

Prompt: Write a 4-5 sentence explaining changes that I made to the concept and any other issues that came up: Seperated my original concept of MediaGallery (which handled media and interactions together) into MediaLibrary (handles only media data, not engagement or analytics) and MediaAnalytics (handles engagement and analytics associated with media) based on Assignment 2 feedback. I also added \_id parameter for easier work with MongoDB and renamed `timestamp` to `createdAt` for better readability.
