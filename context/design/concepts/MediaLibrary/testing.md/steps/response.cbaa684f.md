# response:

To implement the `MediaLibrary` concept, we will create a TypeScript class `MediaLibraryConcept` that interacts with a MongoDB database. We'll follow the concept design principles, ensuring independence, proper state management, and adherence to the action/query signature rules.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Define Concept-Specific Types**: Create TypeScript types for `User`, `Place`, and `MediaItem` based on the concept specification. `User` and `Place` will be `ID` (branded string) as they are external generic parameters.
2. **Map State to MongoDB Collections**: The `MediaLibrary` concept defines "a set of MediaItems". This will translate to a single MongoDB collection named `MediaLibrary.mediaitems`.
3. **Implement Actions**:
   * `seedMedia`: Inserts multiple provider-sourced media items. Includes validation for `urls`.
   * `addMedia`: Adds a single user-contributed media item. Includes validation for `userId`, `placeId`, and `imageUrl`.
4. **Implement Queries**:
   * The `getMediaByPlace` is specified as an action but its effect is a read operation. According to concept design principles and implementation guidelines, query methods must start with an underscore (`_`) and return an array of dictionaries. We will implement it as `_getMediaByPlace`.
5. **Error Handling**: Return `{ error: string }` for expected validation failures or database errors.
6. **MongoDB ID Management**: Use `freshID()` utility for generating new `_id` values for documents.
7. **Documentation**: Include JSDoc comments for the class and each method, reflecting the `purpose`, `requires`, and `effects` from the concept specification.
