# Implementation Highlights and Lessons Learned

[Interesting-Moments](interesting-moments-prev-context.md)

[Media Analytics Concept](concepts/MediaAnalytics/MediaAnalytics.md)

## Interesting Moments

\#1. When I first started working on the `User Preferences` feature, I quickly realized that simply storing user choices wasn't enough. I needed to build a robust system for *how* those preferences influenced content recommendations, which led to a deeper dive into collaborative filtering algorithms than I initially anticipated. It was a good lesson in understanding the downstream implications of a seemingly simple feature.

\#2. Developing the `Real-time Notification Service` presented a significant challenge. While the initial push notification logic was straightforward, ensuring timely delivery, handling concurrent updates, and maintaining a high level of fault tolerance across various user devices made me rethink my asynchronous processing strategies. It pushed me to explore message queues and more resilient error handling patterns.

\#3. When working on the Media Analytics Concept and actually seeing the implementation the LLM created for me, I realized I had a way for users to like, comment, etc on media, but no real way to undo those actions so this is something I have to fix as I iterate through this project.
