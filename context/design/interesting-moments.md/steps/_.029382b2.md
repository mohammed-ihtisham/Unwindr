# Implementation Highlights and Lessons Learned

[text](interesting-moments-prev-context.md)

[Media Analytics Concept](concepts/MediaAnalytics/MediaAnalytics.md)

\#1. When exploring different database solutions, I realized the importance of choosing a schema-less NoSQL database like MongoDB for handling diverse and evolving media metadata, which simplified the data model significantly.

\#2. Integrating the LLM for initial content generation highlighted the need for robust validation and moderation layers. While powerful, the LLM sometimes produced inaccurate or off-topic suggestions, requiring a human-in-the-loop review process.

\#3. When working on the Media Analytics Concept and actually seeing the implementation the LLM created for me, I realized I had a way for users to like, comment, etc on media, but no real way to undo those actions so this is something I have to fix as I iterate through this project.
