Significant design changes were implemented for the `InterestFilter`, primarily focusing on data consistency and user experience. To better align with MongoDB and primitive types, parameters in actions were first renamed for clarity, and `Id` types consistently replaced `User` types throughout the system. User flexibility was enhanced by reducing the minimum requirement for the tag validator to three, preventing unnecessary restrictions on user choices, while a confidence threshold was also introduced for the confidence validator to ensure a baseline quality for generated interests. A major focus was placed on refining contradiction handling: warnings were integrated directly into the concept, and the contradiction validator was updated to facilitate user-driven resolution in the UI, allowing users to choose between opposing tags rather than forcing a system decision. Initial development faced challenges, as the LLM frequently generated mock code and failed to properly leverage context from Assignment 3, particularly in its less robust attempts to handle contradictions through hardcoded examples, necessitating these design refinements.
