# Design Changes to Bookmark

As we shifted the app's focus from contribution to exploration, we identified a critical need for users to save places they discover and are interested in. The Bookmark concept was introduced to address this core exploration workflow requirement, allowing users to build a personal collection of places they want to visit or remember. The concept is designed to be simple, modular, and user-specific: it depends only on `User` and `Place` concepts, ensures complete user isolation (multiple users can bookmark the same place, each seeing only their own bookmarks), and provides essential actions for bookmarking, unbookmarking, retrieving bookmarks, and checking bookmark status. Bookmarks are ordered by creation time (newest first) to support the active exploration workflow. The design is intentionally minimal and focused on the core use case, with room for future enhancements like folders or tags if needed.
