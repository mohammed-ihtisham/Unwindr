# Design Changes to MediaLibrary

Based on Assignment 2 feedback, I significantly refined the `MediaLibrary` concept by separating it from its original `MediaGallery` form. The `MediaGallery`, which previously handled both media data and interactions, has been split into `MediaLibrary` (focusing solely on media data without engagement or analytics) and `MediaAnalytics` (managing all engagement and analytical data associated with media). This ensures a clearer separation of concerns. Additionally, I introduced an `_id` parameter for easier integration and work with MongoDB, and added a `deleteMedia` method so users can remove media they've added, supporting better control and management of their content.

For the purpose of this assignment, we removed the `addMedia` and `deleteMedia` actions, focusing the concept solely on provider-sourced media. This decision was driven by our product focus shifting to place exploration rather than user-generated content. With a small user base, user contributions would not provide sufficient value, and the complexity of managing user-contributed media (including moderation, storage costs, and quality control) was not justified at this stage. The MVP now supports only `seedMedia` for populating provider-sourced images, along with query methods for retrieving media for visual discovery. This simplification allows us to deliver core functionality faster while maintaining the ability to add user contribution features later when the user base grows and the feature becomes more valuable.
