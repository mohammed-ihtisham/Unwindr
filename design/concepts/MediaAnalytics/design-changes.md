# Design Changes to MediaAnalytics

Based on Assignment 2 feedback, I significantly refined the `MediaLibrary` concept by separating it from its original `MediaGallery` form. The `MediaGallery`, which previously handled both media data and interactions, has been split into `MediaLibrary` (focusing solely on media data without engagement or analytics) and `MediaAnalytics` (managing all engagement and analytical data associated with media). This ensures a clearer separation of concerns. Additionally, I introduced an `_id` parameter for easier integration and work with MongoDB, and renamed the `timestamp` field to `createdAt` for enhanced readability and clarity.

However, given that this is a very early-stage app with minimal user traffic, I ultimately decided to remove the `MediaAnalytics` concept for now. Tracking engagement and analytics at this stage does not provide sufficient value and would add operational complexity (storage, queries, maintenance) without meaningful insights. The plan is to revisit analytics later once there is consistent user activity, at which point we can reintroduce a scoped `MediaAnalytics` concept or integrate with a lightweight external analytics service.
