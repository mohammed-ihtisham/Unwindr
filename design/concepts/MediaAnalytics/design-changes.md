# Design Changes to MediaAnalytics

Based on Assignment 2 feedback, I significantly refined the `MediaLibrary` concept by separating it from its original `MediaGallery` form. The `MediaGallery`, which previously handled both media data and interactions, has been split into `MediaLibrary` (focusing solely on media data without engagement or analytics) and `MediaAnalytics` (managing all engagement and analytical data associated with media). This ensures a clearer separation of concerns. Additionally, I introduced an `_id` parameter for easier integration and work with MongoDB, and renamed the `timestamp` field to `createdAt` for enhanced readability and clarity.
