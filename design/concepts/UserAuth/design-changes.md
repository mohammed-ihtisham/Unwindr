# Design Changes to UserAuth

The user authentication concept remains consistent with the original design, with adjustments focused on technical clarity and alignment rather than major functional changes. Key updates include renaming parameters for readability and replacing complex User types with simpler Id or UserId values to better fit MongoDBâ€™s document structure and improve consistency. While refining the design through the LLM context tool, I also identified several logical extensions to enhance completeness and usability. For instance, if users can log in, they should also be able to log out, and if moderators can be granted privileges, those should also be revocable. Additionally, I added an option for users to change their passwords as a thoughtful improvement to both user experience and security. These refinements collectively ensure a more coherent, maintainable, and user-friendly authentication system.
