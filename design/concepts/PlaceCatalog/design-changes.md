# Design Changes to PlaceCatalog

The fundamental concept of the **PlaceCatalog** remains consistent with its original design, but several key refinements were made for functionality and maintainability. An `_id` field was added to support MongoDB integration, serving as a unique identifier for each catalog entry and enabling direct retrieval of place data. The system now primarily uses `userId` and `placeId` (both of type `Id`) instead of full `user` and `place` objects, simplifying relationships and optimizing queries. The **`verify_place`** method was revised to allow both verification and unverification of places, providing flexibility to correct accidental approvals.
